## Quality Gates

| Gate | Criteria |
|------|----------|
| QG1 | Change documented |
| QG2 | Impact assessed |
| QG3 | Risks identified |
| QG4 | Approval obtained |
| QG5 | Implementation planned |
| QG6 | Review complete |

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Shadow IT** — Changes outside process
2. **Rubber stamping** — Approvals without review
3. **Scope creep** — Continuous small changes
4. **Emergency bypass** — Frequent "emergencies"

## Edge Cases

- Failed change: Rollback execution
- Cascade effects: Impact on dependencies
- Out-of-hours changes: On-call procedures
- Rollback not possible: Go-forward strategy

## Output
Use: `templates/change-request.md` | Capability: `capabilities/change-management.md`
