# Workflow 14: Project Planning

**Duration**: 2-8h | **Outputs**: Project plan, resource allocation, timeline, risk register

## Trigger

- New project initiation, sprint planning, release planning
- Resource allocation, timeline creation, stakeholder alignment

## Steps

### Step 1: Scope Definition
Define project objectives, deliverables, success criteria. Identify constraints (time, budget, resources).
**Time**: 30-60 min.

### Step 2: Task Decomposition
Break into epics, stories, tasks. Define dependencies. Identify milestones.
**Time**: 1-2h.

### Step 3: Effort Estimation
Estimate effort (story points, hours). Use historical data. Include buffer for unknowns.
**Time**: 1-2h.

### Step 4: Resource allocation
Assign team members. Identify skill gaps. Plan hiring/training if needed.
**Time**: 30-60 min.

### Step 5: Timeline Creation
Create schedule with milestones. Identify critical path. Plan sprints/iterations.
**Time**: 1-2h.

### Step 6: Risk Identification
Identify project risks. Assess probability/impact. Define mitigation strategies.
**Time**: 30-60 min.

## Quality Gates

| Gate | Criteria |
|------|----------|
| QG1 | Scope defined and approved |
| QG2 | Tasks decomposed |
| QG3 | Effort estimated |
| QG4 | Resources allocated |
| QG5 | Timeline created |
| QG6 | Risks identified |

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Scope creep** — Uncontrolled expansion
2. **Optimistic estimation** — No buffer
3. **Resource overallocation** — Burnout risk
4. **Ignoring dependencies** — Blocked work

## Edge Cases

- Unknown unknowns: Contingency planning
- Team turnover: Knowledge transfer
- External dependencies: Vendor delays
- Scope changes: Change control process

## Output

Use: `templates/project-plan.md` | Capability: `capabilities/project-planning.md`

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Security as afterthought** — Adding security late in development
2. **Tool overload** — Using too many tools without integration
3. **No documentation** — Not documenting security decisions
4. **Ignoring compliance** — Not meeting regulatory requirements

## Edge Cases

- Legacy systems → Use incremental security improvements
- No security team → Use automated tools and external audits
- Zero-day vulnerabilities → Have incident response plan ready
