# Debugging Capability

## Definition

The ability to identify, isolate, and resolve defects through systematic investigation and root cause analysis.

## Proficiency Levels

| Level | Title | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Novice | Can fix obvious bugs but struggles with isolation and root cause |
| 2 | Competent | Can reproduce bugs, isolate components, fix common issues |
| 3 | Proficient | Can perform root cause analysis, implement targeted fixes |
| 4 | Expert | Can handle complex bugs, mentor others, improve processes |
| 5 | Master | Can establish debugging practices, create frameworks, handle novel domains |

## Scope

### In Scope
- Issue reproduction
- Defect isolation
- Root cause analysis
- Fix implementation
- Regression testing
- Prevention strategy
- Debug documentation

### Out of Scope
- Test case design (see Testing capability)
- Architecture changes (see Design capability)
- Infrastructure issues (see Deployment capability)

## Skills

### Reproduction
- Understanding reported issues
- Creating minimal reproduction cases
- Identifying reproduction conditions
- Documenting reproduction steps
- Determining reproducibility
- Capturing evidence (logs, screenshots)

### Isolation
- Binary search debugging
- Git bisect usage
- Strategic logging
- Debugger usage
- Variable isolation
- Configuration isolation
- Memory analysis

### Root Cause Analysis
- 5 Whys technique
- Fishbone (Ishikawa) analysis
- Fault tree analysis
- Change analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Hypothesis testing

### Fix Implementation
- Fix design and evaluation
- Minimal, targeted fixes
- Defensive coding
- Test creation for fixes
- Regression prevention

### Prevention
- Automated test addition
- Static analysis rule creation
- Code review checklist updates
- Monitoring improvements
- Knowledge sharing

## Development Path

To improve debugging capability:
1. Study systematic debugging techniques
2. Practice with real bugs
3. Learn root cause analysis methods
4. Study common bug patterns
5. Practice creating minimal reproduction cases
6. Seek feedback on debugging approach
