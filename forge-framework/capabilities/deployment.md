# Deployment Capability

## Definition

The ability to release software to target environments through planning, execution, and post-deployment verification.

## Proficiency Levels

| Level | Title | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Novice | Can deploy using existing scripts but struggles with planning |
| 2 | Competent | Can plan and execute basic deployments, set up monitoring |
| 3 | Proficient | Can design deployment strategies, handle rollbacks, set up alerting |
| 4 | Expert | Can handle complex deployments, mentor others, improve processes |
| 5 | Master | Can establish deployment practices, create frameworks, handle novel domains |

## Scope

### In Scope
- Deployment planning
- Environment setup and configuration
- Deployment execution
- Post-deployment verification
- Rollback execution
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Database migration during deployment

### Out of Scope

## Metrics
- Deployment frequency
- Deployment success rate
- Mean time to deploy (MTTD)
- Rollback rate
- Deployment-related incidents
- Time to recovery (TTR)

## Development Path

To improve deployment capability:
1. Study deployment strategies and patterns
2. Practice with different deployment tools
3. Learn Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
4. Study monitoring and observability practices
5. Practice rollback procedures
6. Seek feedback on deployment quality
